StatBash: Choose a certain number of statistics to beat a randomly generated computer's stats. Is there a best way to play??
Each team gets 5 random  fighting tokens. You may use 1 token point for each of the following, although (g)eneral tokens cost 2.
(f)ire - beats p, beaten by w
(w)ater - beats f, beaten by p
(p)lant - beats w, beaten by f
(g)eneral - beats everything except g

(Later feature)You may also heal any shields at a cost of 2 tokens per 1 shield. Core health points cannot be healed in a given round

Each player has 2 shields of each of the 3 elements, and then 3 core health points after that:
f ++
w ++
p ++
health +++

Let's just make it really simple and say I can only choose 5 tokens, either f, w, or p, and the computer randomly generates 5 of any of those too. Order matters! Let's say I choose pwffp. The computer randomly generates fpfpw. Let's look at the breakdown on this:
p + f = -p 
w + p = -w
f + f = 0
f + p = p-
p + w = w-

Results: Me:
f ++
w +-
p +-
health +++

Cp:
f ++
w +-
p +-
health +++

Feature Ideas:
-Recharge 1 random shield every time I beat the computer
